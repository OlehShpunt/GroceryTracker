Tesseract OCR - psm and oem Guide
==================================

psm: Page Segmentation Mode
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This tells Tesseract how to segment the page before reading text.
It controls the layout assumption â€” single line, block, paragraph, sparse text, etc.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0  - Orientation and script detection (OSD) only.
  1  - Automatic page segmentation with OSD.
  2  - Automatic page segmentation, no OSD or OCR.
  3  - Fully automatic page segmentation (default).
  4  - Assume a single column of text of variable sizes.
  5  - Assume a single uniform block of vertically aligned text.
  6  - Assume a single uniform block of text.
  7  - Treat the image as a single text line.
  8  - Treat the image as a single word.
  9  - Treat the image as a single word in a circle.
 10  - Treat the image as a single character.
 11  - Sparse text. Find as much text as possible in no particular order.
 12  - Sparse text with OSD.
 13  - Raw line. Treat the image as a single text line, skipping Tesseract-specific hacks.


oem: OCR Engine Mode
-------------------------------------
This selects which OCR engine to use:
-------------------------------------

  0 - Legacy engine only                                    NOT WORKING
  1 - LSTM neural net engine only (modern, accurate)
  2 - Legacy + LSTM combined                                NOT WORKING
  3 - Default: LSTM, fall back if needed (recommended)


Best options for receipts:
---------------------------------------------------------------
--psm 6 = Assume a single uniform block of text (recommended)
--psm 4 = Single column (if structured vertically)
--psm 11 = Sparse text (for messy layouts)
