To start the server, run this command
    pipenv run flask --debug run -h 0.0.0.0

But it will run on the Flask's default port 5000, 
which is already taken on MacOS. You have to bind a different
port (e.g. 5001) by running:
    flask run --port 5001
or
    flask run -p 5001

For more help info run:
    flask run --help

To see anything in the browser (GET results), enter
the link + route that is marked above the GET method
in the backend/src/index.py file, e.g.:
    http://127.0.0.1:5001/incomes
    http://127.0.0.1:PORT/route-url-above-get-method
